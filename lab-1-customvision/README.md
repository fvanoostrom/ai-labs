# Lab 1 - Azure Custom Vision

## Introduction

This lab covers classifying images. A classification algorithm is able to seperate objects into multiple categories. An algorithm could classify different kind of objects, like numbers, text or even sounds and images. Within this lab we will classify an image into one of three categories of fruit: an apple, orange or banana.

A Classification is a supervised learning problem. This means that we provide a training set with a label for each object.
